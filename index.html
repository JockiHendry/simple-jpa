          <h3>What is simple-jpa?</h3>

<p>simple-jpa is a Griffon’s plugin for developing JPA and Swing based desktop application.  The main goal of simple-jpa is to allow developer to concentrate on business logic.  simple-jpa provides much functionality that is needed when working with JPA, therefore, frees developer from writing high-ceremony code.</p>

<p>simple-jpa is very useful for rapidly developing Swing-based database oriented desktop application.  It can also be used for prototyping.</p>

<p>The following is a list of some of simple-jpa’s features:</p>

<p><strong>Scaffolding</strong> – simple-jpa can generate an MVCGroup based on a domain class.  This will speed up development.</p>

<p><strong>Dynamic finders</strong> – simple-jpa injects dynamic finders to controllers (or services).  With dynamic finders, developer can perform a query on JPA entities (or domain objects) quickly and easily.  simple-jpa also supports the execution of JPA named query, JPQL and native SQL.</p>

<p><strong>Transaction management</strong> – Unlike web-based applications, desktop applications do not require Java Transaction API (JTA).  simple-jpa automatically provides and manages transaction for each method in controllers (can be configured by using annotation).  By default, simple-jpa will share EntityManager across transaction in a way that is suitable for desktop application.</p>

<p><strong>Bean Validation API (JSR-303) support</strong> – In the case of failed validation, simple-jpa will automatically present error messages in Swing-based view.  Developer can also configure error notification and its behavior.</p>

<p><strong>Common database application features</strong> – simple-jpa adds the following to all domain classes: an id (auto generated primary key), fields that store created time and last modified time (will be filled automatically), and a soft delete flag (soft delete is marking the object as inactive without deleting it from database).</p>

<p><strong>Swing nodes for database application</strong> - simple-jpa provides template renderer for effortlessly represent domain object in JTable, JList or JComboBox.  It also provides new nodes that can be used in Griffon’s view such as tagChooser, numberTextField, maskTextField, and dateTimePicker.</p>

<p><strong>Integration testing</strong> – simple-jpa is using dbUnit in integration testing to fill database with predefined data from a Microsoft Excel file (or csv file).  This way, every test cases will be executed with the same table data.</p>
